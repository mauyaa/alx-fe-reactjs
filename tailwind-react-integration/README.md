# React JS with a CSS Framework — Tailwind CSS Integration

This project demonstrates integrating Tailwind CSS with a React (Vite) app and building a responsive, interactive `UserProfile` component.

## Quick Start

```bash
# From the project root
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL to view the app.

## What’s Included

- Tailwind wired via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (no tailwind.config needed).
- Responsive utilities for image, typography, and container sizing.
- Interactivity: hover scale on the profile image, hover color on heading, and shadow lift on card.
- Files:
  - `vite.config.js`
  - `index.html`
  - `src/index.css` (imports Tailwind)
  - `src/main.jsx`
  - `src/App.jsx`
  - `src/components/UserProfile.jsx`
```

## Notes

- If you host multiple projects in a single repo (e.g., `alx-fe-reactjs`), place this whole folder under `tailwind-react-integration/` before committing.
