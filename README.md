# ALX FE ReactJS â€” Projects Bundle

This archive contains three ready-to-run React projects for the tasks:

- **alx-react-app-new**: Inline styling + Counter (hooks)
- **alx-react-app-props**: Refactor prop drilling to Context API
- **my-company**: 4-page React Router website

## How to use

1) Unzip into your repository root (so you have `alx-fe-reactjs/` with these three folders inside).
2) For each project:
   ```bash
   cd <project>
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3) Commit and push.

> If you already have an `alx-react-app` in your repo, these projects are self-contained equivalents that satisfy the tasks.
